### 🚀 Next Moves
- Push to GitHub (private or public)
- Add contributors/invite-only collab maybe?
- NPM publish if you want `npx funky-run myfile.run-e`
- Bonus: Add `--watch` or even GUI for a “script playground”

---

If you're building this out… bro… people will totally want to write `.run-e` scripts for it.  
This could end up like an artist’s modular synth for interactive UI. 🤘🔥

Let me know if you want help building a `README`, a landing page, or kicking off that first GitHub commit message. 🪩
